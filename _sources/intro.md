# Introduction to Software Development Tools and Tricks.

This course introduces people to the tools and tricks of software development. Key topics include:
- Learning to design software and structure code
- Working with others to develop software
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Debugging and (automatic) Testing
- Best practices, including comprehensive documentation.

The course is project-based, meaning that there is little to no lecturing. Instead, useful resources are posted on the web site and participants work together to build/refine/develop software packages. This would be impossible without the assistance of many talented and experienced volunteers.

I strongly recommend using VSCode as your IDE, but PyCharm can also work well.
