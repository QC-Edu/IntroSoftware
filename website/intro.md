# Introduction to Software Development Tools and Tricks.

This course introduces people to the tools and tricks of software development. Key topics include:
- Learning to design software and structure code
- Working with others to develop software
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Debugging and (automatic) Testing
- Best practices, including comprehensive documentation.

The course is project-based, meaning that there is little to no lecturing. Instead, useful resources are posted on the web site and participants work together to build/refine/develop software packages. This would be impossible without the assistance of many talented and experienced volunteers.

I strongly recommend using VSCode as your IDE, but PyCharm can also work well.

## Projects
Previous iterations of this course led to open-source packages, including:
- [GBasis](https://gbasis.qcdevs.org/intro.html) Analytical evaluation and integration of Gaussian-type basis functions and related quantities.
- [Grid](https://grid.qcdevs.org/) Numerical integration, interpolation, and differentiation on (molecular) grids.
- [Selector](https://selector.qcdevs.org/intro.html) Methods for selecting diverse (molecular) database.
- [Model Hamiltonian](https://moha.qcdevs.org/build/html/index.html) Generate 1- and 2-electron integrals so that molecular quantum chemistry software can be used for model Hamiltonians.

This year, we will be working with
- [ChemTools](https://chemtools.org/) A collection of interpretive chemical tools for analyzing outputs of the quantum chemistry calculations. (We will use the private repository rather than the public-facing one, however.) For more, [see the private GitHub repository](https://github.com/QC-Edu/2024CHEM799)

- [PyCI](https://pyci.qcdevs.org/intro.html) Flexible ab-initio quantum chemistry library for (parameterized) configuration interaction calculations. For more, [see the private GitHub repository](https://github.com/QC-Edu/2024CHEM799)

For people who would like to follow the course but who are not formally enrolled, it's recommended to select issues from QC-Devs packages that have been labelled as "Good First Issues." QC-Devs packages are released through the [theochem GitHub organization](https://github.com/theochem).

## Using and Contributing
- [**QC-Devs Code of Conduct:**](https://github.com/theochem/guidelines/blob/main/CodeOfConduct.md) Treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy; assume they're doing the same. Communicate clearly. Be helpful. Be open. Be nice. If someone says stop; stop.
- [**How to Contribute:**](https://github.com/theochem/guidelines/blob/main/contributing.md) Contributions are accepted and encouraged! This includes contributions from those who are not formally, or informally, involved/enrolled in the course.
- [**CC0 version 1.0**](/website/license.md) license. But where we have reposted/adapted/linked content from other sources, they retain their own copyright/license.

## QC-Edu
This course is part of the [QC-Edu initiative](https://qc-edu.org/intro.html), which is the educational arm of the QC-Devs organization. The goal of QC-Edu is to provide hig.h-quality, open-source educational resources for quantum chemistry and related fields. QC-Edu was envisioned, and is supported, by Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh, Valerii Chuiko, and Paul W. Ayers.
